# Bad Code Example

This is a project showing code which does not align with clean code principles.

## Questions
### What is the purpose of the code?
The Application creates two instances of the class "MyLife".

### What are the weaknesses of the code? 
The class "MyLife" has only one large method, which is a little bit confusing.

### What can be done to improve the code?
I tried to create several smaller methods. Some functionalities are written more than once in the original code. I tried to avoid that.
I also created more classes and i hope, that the code is now easier to maintain. Also i added some comments to explain the code.
